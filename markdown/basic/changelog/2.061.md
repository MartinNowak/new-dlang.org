# Change Log &ndash; v2.061

## New Features

DMD now shows deprecated features as warnings by default (a message is
displayed but compilation is not halted anymore). There are also 2 new
compiler flags: -de, to get the old default behaviour (using deprecated
features is an error) and -dw, to explicitly enable the new default behaviour
(just warn). This makes it possible to add -de in the configuration file to get
the old default and still be able to override that default by using -dw when
compiling. The -d flag stays the same (silently ignore deprecated features).

**Add lists here, or I break you.**
